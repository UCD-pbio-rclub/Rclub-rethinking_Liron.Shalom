## 2E1 - 4 (not sure...)

## 2E2 - 3

## 2E3 - 1

## 2E4 - It means that if you toss the globe 10 times, on approximately 7 of these it will fall on water. 
By saying that “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST” he meant that probability is just a way to describe reality, 
but it is not reality itself.  I think that the real “reality” value requires an infinite number of tosses 
and since the subjective observer can never provide infinite values or data, he can never describe 
reality as it really is.

## 2M3 - Pr(Earth|land) = (Pr(land|Earth) * Pr(Earth)) / Pr(land) = (0.3 * 0.5) / 0.65 = 0.23

## 2M4 - Conditional on seeing black, # ways the chosen card could produce:
white x white = 0
white X black = 1
black x black = 2
Total ways to produce black = 3. 
Hence, probability to produce black x black = 2/3.
